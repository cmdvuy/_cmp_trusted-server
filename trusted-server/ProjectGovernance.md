# Project Governance for The Trusted Server

The Trusted Server project will be governed as an open-source initiative, in accordance with the established guidelines of the IAB Tech Lab Open Source initiative. However, certain key distinctions apply:

* The Trusted Server Task Force shall be responsible for the definition of requirements and the project roadmap.
* The Task Force shall adhere to the working group rules and procedures of the Tech Lab.
* The Trusted Server Development Team shall oversee engineering development and releases.

## The Trusted Server Task Force

A dedicated Task Force has been constituted by the Tech Lab to oversee the requirements and roadmap for the Trusted Server initiative. The core mandate of the Task Force is to review, approve, and prioritize proposals, issues, and pull requests submitted by the community for the Trusted Server.

The Task Force shall adhere to the working group rules and procedures of the Tech Lab for decision-making and management of the Trusted Server roadmap, with one exception: in recognition of the project's open-source nature, a formal public comment release period will not be instituted. Software releases will be conducted on a continuous basis.

The Task Force will convene biweekly, and detailed meeting minutes will be meticulously maintained within the Trusted Server GitHub repository.

## The Trusted Server Development Team

The Development Team shall be responsible for the evaluation of technical feasibility of requirements, the definition of system architecture, and the construction of the Trusted Server in alignment with the roadmap established by the Task Force. The team composition is as follows:

* **Project Release Manager:** This individual holds ultimate responsibility for project development and possesses 'write' access to the repository.
* **Committer:** This developer possesses 'write' access to the repository and is responsible for implementing final changes.
* **Developer:** This contributor contributes to the project through code or documentation and may assume further project management responsibilities.

The Development Team shall be responsible for the development and release of the Trusted Server and will establish its own sprint and meeting schedule.
